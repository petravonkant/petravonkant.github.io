Things never turn out the way you expect. This is especially the case when a kite is involved.

I had bought the kite as a gift for Jack, at a shop in the Outer Banks. There, the high winds that at one point attracted Wilbur and Orville Wright in their search for a proving ground now contribute to a lively, if not tourist-y, kite-flying scene and a number of specialized retailers. The kite is of the box type, meaning that before you can fly it, you’ve got to give it rigidity by inserting various cross-struts in an X-shape. The instructions themselves are of the sparse IKEA kind, a couple numbered blurbs whirling aimlessly about a plain, matter-of-fact graphic. Crucially, they make no mention of the twistings and deformations needed to coax the struts into their awfully tense repose.
